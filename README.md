WinRM transport logic for re-using remote shells and uploading files. The original code was extracted from the [Test Kitchen][test_kitchen] project and remains the primary reference use case.

## Deprecation Notice

The functionality provided by this library has been merged into [winrm](https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM) and [winrm-fs](https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM-fs). Following the release of Test-Kitchen 1.6, this library will no longer be used and thus no longer be maintained.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'winrm-transport'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install winrm-transport

## Usage

This is a library gem and doesn't have any CLI commands. There are 2 primary object classes:

* [WinRM::Transport::CommandExecutor][command_executor]: an object which can
  execute multiple commands and PowerShell script in one shared remote shell
  session.
* [WinRM::Transport::FileTransporter][file_transporter]: an object which can
  upload one or more files or directories to a remote host over WinRM only
  using PowerShell scripts and CMD commands.
